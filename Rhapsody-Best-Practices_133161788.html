      <p>Rhapsody best practice guidelines are provided with the intention of&nbsp;helping you to develop your own best practices to guide users for designing and implementing Rhapsody configurations in a standardized and efficient manner. Refer to:</p>
      <ul>
       <li><p><a href="Naming-Conventions_133163659.html">Naming Conventions</a>.</p></li>
       <li><p><a href="Route-Design-Considerations_133162026.html">Route Design Considerations</a>.</p></li>
       <li><p><a href="Virtualization-Best-Practices_133164240.html">Virtualization Best Practices</a>.</p></li>
       <li><p><a href="Maintenance-Guidelines_133164144.html">Maintenance Guidelines</a>.</p></li>
       <li><a href="Upgrading-Checklist_133164180.html">Upgrading Checklist</a>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The guidance provided within Rhapsody product documentation is not intended to be prescriptive as there may be situations where a given solution is required to deviate from the recommended approach to fulfill the solution requirements. Where site-specific best practice guidance exists, then that guidance takes precedence.</p>
      <p>By adhering to best practice guidelines wherever possible, you can ensure that your solutions are:</p>
      <ul>
       <li>Error free (configuration should implement the specification correctly).</li>
       <li>Maintainable (component purpose and function should be clear).</li>
       <li>Able to guarantee that all messages should reach the correct destination in the correct form.</li>
       <li>Able to&nbsp;guarantee that messages which invoke an exception in processing are identifiable and processed appropriately.</li>
       <li>Able to&nbsp;guarantee that messages are processed through the engine in a timely manner (as required by the system specification).</li>
       <li>Documented consistently.</li>
       <li>Aligned with the intended use of Rhapsody.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Best practice guidance is subject to change over time due to:</p>
      <ul>
       <li>New or improved functionality within Rhapsody or its underlying JVM architecture.</li>
       <li>Improved engine and component efficiency.</li>
       <li>Newly-adopted and field-tested patterns which better address solutions to customer requirements, or which have been adopted as a means of resolving identified issues from past practices.</li>
      </ul>
