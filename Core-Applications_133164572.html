      <h2 id="CoreApplications-ServerApplication">Server Application</h2>
      <h3 id="CoreApplications-RhapsodyEngine">Rhapsody Engine</h3>
      <p>The Rhapsody Engine (Engine) is the main messaging service that implements:</p>
      <ul>
       <li>Communications.</li>
       <li>Mapping.</li>
       <li>Message delivery.</li>
       <li>Data transformation and routing of data.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Messages enter the Engine via input communication points, and then pass through a series of filters before exiting the Engine via output communication points. The Engine analyzes the incoming messages to determine which steps, procedures, or filters need to be applied in handling the message and sending it to its destination.&nbsp;A file-system based datastore is&nbsp;used to&nbsp;store the engine configuration and state information, as well as the message archive.</p>
      <p>EDI Message Designer and third-party XSD editors are used to create message definition files that inform Rhapsody of the structure of the messages it is processing. Custom filters and communication points can be created and dynamically loaded to augment the engine's capabilities.</p>
      <h2 id="CoreApplications-ConfigurationApplications">Configuration Applications</h2>
      <h3 id="CoreApplications-RhapsodyIDE">Rhapsody IDE</h3>
      <p>The Rhapsody Integrated Development Environment (Rhapsody IDE) is an easy-to-use graphical user interface used to control and manage the functionality of the Engine. Rhapsody IDE enables interface developers to configure and control the operation of the engine itself. The configuration and control of the Engine are achieved by creating routes which are compositions of defined communication points and filters.</p>
      <p>Rhapsody IDE is a standard <em>Windows</em>® application that runs on a client PC and establishes a secure connection to the machine hosting the Engine. On start-up, the current configuration is presented to the user through the GUI, along with the status of all components; for example, not configured, stopped, started, and so on. The status of components can be changed by selecting the component and then clicking a toolbar button or by right-clicking and selecting an option from the component's context menu.</p>
      <h3 id="CoreApplications-RhapsodyMessagingToolkit">Rhapsody Messaging Toolkit</h3>
      <h4 id="CoreApplications-EDIDesigner">EDI Designer</h4>
      <p>The EDI Designer is used to create the definition of the messaging system that you want to parse or create. The message definition defines the structure and separators of the messaging system and is the information the Engines need to create valid messages. The definition also contains information on how to validate incoming messages.</p>
      <p>Once completed, the message definition can then be loaded into EDI&nbsp;Explorer, or used to create a parser control file (for use in the C++, COM or Java dynamic engines), a dynamically generated Active X object, or some static Java classes.</p>
      <h4 id="CoreApplications-EDIExplorer">EDI Explorer</h4>
      <p>EDI Explorer is an application that allows the visual creation and testing of messages. Explorer requires a message definition, created in the EDI Message Designer, and follows the structure defined in that definition. Explorer can connect to an external system to send and receive messages over TCP/IP.</p>
      <p>EDI&nbsp;Explorer is an easy to use application used for building and testing EDI messages. Explorer will load a Symphonia 3 message definition file (<code>*.s3d</code> file), and allow the user to create messages from the definition. Explorer allows these messages to be placed in a text file, or to be sent over a communications system, such as TCP.</p>
      <h4 id="CoreApplications-MapDesigner">Map Designer</h4>
      <p>The Map Designer is an application that allows users to quickly create mapping specifications between input hierarchical data type definitions and output hierarchical data type definitions. Currently, these hierarchical data type definitions may be XML schemas, XML DTDs or EDI message definitions. Database interaction is also possible using stored procedure calls.</p>
      <p>The Mapping specification can then be used to map actual input instances to output instances. An instance of an EDI message definition refers to a flat wire message, while an instance of an XML, schema or DTD refers to an XML document. The Mapper supports the following EDI messaging standards: HL7, X.12, HIPAA, EDIFACT, UB92, ASTM, NCPDP as well as custom definitions. The Mapper also supports XML W3C DTDs and <em>Microsoft</em>® compatible schemas.</p>
      <p>Many applications refer to the same information using different labels. For example, cultural background may be called 'Ethnicity' in one application but be referred to as 'Race' by another. Map Designer efficiently maps message structures so they can be understood by all applications that refer to them.</p>
      <h2 id="CoreApplications-MonitoringandManagementApplications">Monitoring and Management Applications</h2>
      <h3 id="CoreApplications-ManagementConsole">Management Console</h3>
      <p>The&nbsp;<a href="Management-Console_133163667.html">Management Console</a>&nbsp;is a web-based application which enables you to view, edit, and resend messages in the Engine. Additionally, you can monitor system logs and error conditions. The Management Console is designed for a wider range of users than the Administration application and is intended as the first point of reference for day-to-day message processing.</p>
      <p>The status of Rhapsody components is identified by color-coded icons. For example, a route that has stopped is easily identified and can usually be restarted with a single click. A list of messages on the Error or Hold queues can readily be viewed and you can select messages in bulk for resending, releasing or permanent removal. Additionally, the content of individual messages can be viewed and edited before resending to their original destination or to any other route component.</p>
      <p>Access to the Rhapsody Log is also available. Detailed statistical information can be viewed, including average and maximum/minimum counts of the messages processed by individual routes or the engine as a whole. Statistical results can be presented graphically to aid interpretation.</p>
      <h3 id="CoreApplications-RhapsodyDashboard">Rhapsody Dashboard</h3>
      <p><i>Rhapsody Dashboard</i>&nbsp;is a web-based application which enables you to monitor the overall health of multiple Rhapsody engines from a single interface.</p>
      <h3 id="CoreApplications-RhapsodyMobile">Rhapsody Mobile</h3>
      <p><i>Rhapsody&nbsp;Mobile</i>&nbsp;is a smartphone application for Android and iOS that provides the basic monitoring capability of the Management Console.</p>
