      <h2 id="What'sNew-UsabilityEnhancements"><span>Usability Enhancements</span></h2>
      <p><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">In addition to being rebranded, Rhapsody IDE's user interface has been refreshed and made more intuitive. </span></p>
      <p>Rhapsody&nbsp;IDE now better supports&nbsp;<em>Windows</em>&nbsp;high DPI&nbsp;scaling required to get the most out of high-resolution screens that are becoming increasingly more common.</p>
      <h2 id="What'sNew-Announcements">Announcements</h2>
      <p><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">Rhapsody IDE's start page now keeps users informed with communications and announcements, such as the availability of new releases and upcoming Rhapsody events.</span></p>
      <h2 id="What'sNew-ContinuedRoutingonFailure">Continued Routing on Failure</h2>
      <p>Rhapsody 6.4 introduced <a href="Advanced-Routing_133308065.html">Advanced Routing</a> in&nbsp;the form of <a href="Continued-Routing-on-Success_142330783.html">Continued Routing on Success</a> to support store-and-forward and deposit-and-notify workflows.&nbsp;Rhapsody 6.5 extends Advanced Routing through <a href="Continued-Routing-on-Failure_142330793.html">Continued Routing on Failure</a>. Messages that fail to transmit are <span style="color: rgb(33,33,33);">re-routed via the communication point's error output connector&nbsp;and </span>populated with message properties which capture the failure reason.&nbsp;These message properties can then be used to automate error handling.</p>
      <h2 id="What'sNew-DICOMSupporton64-bitEngines">DICOM Support on 64-bit Engines</h2>
      <p>In this release,&nbsp;new&nbsp;<a href="DICOM-Filters_133163332.html">DICOM filters</a> have been introduced that are supported by both 32-bit and 64-bit Rhapsody engines. Customers processing DICOM messages can now leverage a 64-bit engine and process higher throughputs and larger messages by giving their engines access to more memory.</p>
      <h2 id="What'sNew-ProductUsage"><span style="color: rgb(51,51,51);">Product Usage</span></h2>
      <p>Rhapsody is embracing data-driven decision-making to deliver verified, meaningful solutions. Rhapsody 6.5 gathers product usage data using an opt-out model. The engine automatically sends engine metrics and a configuration summary to a Rhapsody data warehouse. Sensitive data, however, is not collected. The data will influence everything from the&nbsp;<span style="color: inherit;">prioritization of features in the roadmap to&nbsp;</span>improvements in documentation and training.</p>
      <h2 id="What'sNew-TestExecutionandMonitoringviatheRESTAPI">Test Execution and Monitoring via the REST API</h2>
      <p>In Rhapsody 6.5, the test execution and monitoring functionality offered by the <a href="Test-Manager_133161890.html">Test Manager</a> is now exposed via the <a href="Filter-Testing_133168932.html">REST API</a>. This enables users to incorporate filter testing into a continuous integration workflow.</p>
      <h2 id="What'sNew-OpenJDKAdoption">OpenJDK Adoption</h2>
      <p>Rhapsody 6.5 has adopted AdoptOpenJDK instead of Oracle's JRE for 64-bit engines on Linux and Microsoft&nbsp;<em>Windows</em>. Refer to&nbsp;<a href="JRE-Version-and-Update-Policy_133164593.html#JREVersionandUpdatePolicy-JREVersions">JRE Versions</a> for details.</p>
      <h2 class="O1" id="What'sNew-AdditionalImprovements">Additional Improvements</h2>
      <p>Rhapsody 6.5 includes a number of minor improvements:</p>
      <ul>
       <li class="O0">REST API methods have been added for exporting system logs and audit logs, and managing product usage settings.</li>
       <li class="O0">A&nbsp;<a href="Message-Collector-Search_142331746.html">Message Collector Search</a> page has been added to the Management Console.</li>
       <li class="O0"><p>The <a href="Directory_133162648.html">Directory</a> communication point has been enhanced to give it greater feature parity with the (S)FTP communication point.</p></li>
       <li>Bulk selection of users in the User Manager for password expiry.</li>
      </ul>
