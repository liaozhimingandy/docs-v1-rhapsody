      <h2 id="UsingRhapsodyDocumentation-RhapsodyDocumentationOverview">Rhapsody Documentation Overview</h2>
      <p>Rhapsody product documentation envisages three types of users for Rhapsody:</p>
      <ul>
       <li><a href="Monitoring-Rhapsody_133163664.html">Monitor</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;users who monitor the day-to-day health of the engine, such as: logging into the Management Console; viewing and&nbsp;managing messages; and performing tasks that allow them to monitor the day-to-day health of the engine.</li>
       <li><a href="Developing-Rhapsody_133161055.html">Developer</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;users who&nbsp;design and develop routes and interfaces for the engine, such as: logging into Rhapsody&nbsp;IDE; viewing and managing configurations; and developing interfaces (as well as tasks allotted to the monitor).</li>
       <li><a href="Administering-Rhapsody_133160982.html">Administrator</a>&nbsp;- users who perform administrative tasks on the engine, such as: managing users and access rights; and maintaining backup schedules and licenses (as well as tasks allotted to the monitor and developer).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The documentation is orientated towards these three overlapping roles and is roughly categorized as such.</p>
      <p>Rhapsody products are supplied with a full set of administration and installation manuals, in both PDF and web-based formats. The&nbsp;<a href="Printable-Documents_133164597.html">Printable Documents</a>&nbsp;page provides links to downloadable versions of the manuals, release notes and known issues in&nbsp;PDF&nbsp;format for each version of Rhapsody.</p>
      <h2 id="UsingRhapsodyDocumentation-RhapsodyTermsandDefinitions">Rhapsody Terms and Definitions</h2>
      <p>The web-based documentation includes a <a href="Rhapsody-Glossary_133164568.html">Rhapsody Glossary</a>&nbsp;containing definitions of the terms used throughout the documentation.</p>
