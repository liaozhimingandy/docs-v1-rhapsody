      <p>Communication points that use TCP connections will only detect that the connection has been closed by the remote end when attempting to send or receive a message on the connection. Once Rhapsody attempts to send or receive a message on the connection, the end-of-file will be encountered, and the socket will be closed. If the communication point is a client then it will apply its connection retry strategy.</p>
      <p>When communication points are in&nbsp;<em>Output</em> <span> or </span> <em>Out-&gt;In</em> <span> mode they will wait for messages to be delivered before sending them. This means that there can be long periods of inactivity during which the state of the connection is assumed to be connected but it may have actually been closed by the remote end.</span></p>
      <p>This can cause problems for client communication points because the remote end will not be available when it needs to send the message. After exhausting all the connection retry attempts the communication point will stop in error and a notification will be raised. Only at this point will users that have subscribed to this notification be aware that the remote end is unavailable. This can waste valuable time that could have been spent notifying the administrators of the remote end that their system is unavailable which could have been resolved by the time Rhapsody actually needed to send a message.</p>
      <p>Connection Monitoring enables a client/server communication point to determine whether a remote host has dropped the connection without waiting for a message to be sent or received. After a 30-second period of inactivity on a socket (in other words, no reads or writes to the socket), the communication point attempts to read from the socket (with a minimal timeout to avoid blocking) to determine whether the remote end has closed the connection.</p>

      <p><span>This will enable Connection Monitoring on all applicable communication points in the engine. It cannot be configured per communication point.</span></p>
      <p><span style="background-color: transparent;line-height: 13.0pt;"><span style="line-height: 13.0pt;">For these cases, it is&nbsp;</span><span style="background-color: transparent;">preferable</span><span style="line-height: 13.0pt;">&nbsp;to modify the configuration of the communication point rather than disabling Connection Monitoring. One or more of the following settings should be modified to get the desired&nbsp;</span><span style="background-color: transparent;">behavior.&nbsp;</span>There may be rare cases where enabling Connection Monitoring is conceived of as undesirable because the remote end is known to be unreliable. Previously this may have been acceptable if by the time a message was ready to be sent, the remote end was available again. In this case, the communication point would have applied the connection retry strategy and successfully reconnected without having to stop in error. With Connection Monitoring enabled, the retry strategy would be applied much sooner which could potentially cause the communication point to stop in error when it would not have previously.</span></p>
