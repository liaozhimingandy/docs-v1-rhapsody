      <p>Rhapsody's Management Console is a web-based application used to sort, view, edit and re-send messages processed by Rhapsody engine (Rhapsody). It includes an extensive statistics facility along with tools for viewing entries in the Rhapsody log. It focuses on providing monitoring and notification capabilities that make it easier to see the important problems without overloading users with information. The new alert types, configuration and navigation changes all combine to provide an intuitive system for diagnosing issues.</p>
      <p>The Management Console is designed to allow administrators to easily see the status of all interfaces. Connections to external systems that have stopped due to an error are visually highlighted in the graphical display and component-specific log views allow quick identification of when events occurred.</p>
      <p>The Management Console is also used to display information relating to&nbsp;Rhapsody, including:</p>
      <ul>
       <li>High-level system status overview.</li>
       <li>The status (started or stopped) of individual routes and communication points.</li>
       <li>The number and content of messages currently in the Hold and Error queues.</li>
       <li>Messages:
        <ul>
         <li>Input Search - locate messages received on an input communication point.</li>
         <li>Output Search - locate messages based on destination, time and acknowledgment status criteria.</li>
         <li>Route Search - locate messages at the point they are received by each route that processed them.</li>
         <li>Recent Search Results - view all searches for the current session.</li>
        </ul></li>
       <li>Server State Values:
        <ul>
         <li>View the system log and audit log files.</li>
        </ul></li>
       <li>Server Maintenance:
        <ul>
         <li>Manage the backup schedule for the Rhapsody message store.</li>
         <li>Remove old data from the Rhapsody message store.</li>
        </ul></li>
      </ul>
      <p>The Management Console highlights exceptional circumstances such as system connections that are not operating, interfaces that are not keeping up with the required throughput, as well as allowing access to critical administration tasks and logs.</p>
      <p>The Management Console also allows access to copies of all messages processed by the engine. Messages are stored in the Rhapsody archive for a configurable period of time (referred to as the archive period) and during that time they can be resent and reprocessed as required. The full path (including splits) of each message can be viewed.</p>
