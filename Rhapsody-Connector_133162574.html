      <p>The <strong>Rhapsody Connector</strong> communication point&nbsp;can be used as part of a Rhapsody-to-Rhapsody connection, or as the Rhapsody end point of a connection to an external application using the Rhapsody Connector API. The Rhapsody Connector API can be used in external Java applications and is included in the Rhapsody RDK.</p>
      <p>The Rhapsody Connector communication point streams messages and all their message properties across an underlying TCP transport. In addition, if the Rhapsody engine is aware of the character encoding of the message (in other words, it has been explicitly set by a character translation filter or JavaScript filter), then it is transmitted along with the message body.</p>
      <p>The Rhapsody Connector protocol supports some additional functionality to improve the reliability of these communications, for example:</p>
      <ul>
       <li>A protocol acknowledgement mechanism is automatically included to ensure that messages have been completely received by the remote system before being regarded as sent.</li>
       <li>Keep-alive requests and responses are used at a configurable interval to ensure the connection is still valid, and has not been closed by an overly zealous firewall.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>When a message property of a message is greater than 5,242,623 bytes in size, the Rhapsody Connector&nbsp;communication point sends it to the Error Queue.</p>
      <p>Operating Modes: <em>All</em></p>
      <h2 id="RhapsodyConnector-ConfigurationProperties">Configuration Properties</h2>
      <p>The <strong>Rhapsody Connector</strong> communication point can operate in client or server mode. Many of its properties are independent of the mode that it is operating in.</p>

      <h2 id="RhapsodyConnector-ConnectionCapabilities">Connection Capabilities</h2>
      <p>The Rhapsody Connector API allows each connection to be tagged with a set of required and optional capabilities. These capabilities are strings that simply describe how a particular connection will be used. If a host requires a particular capability, then the remote host must also support the same capability or the connection cannot be established.</p>
      <p>Capabilities provide a mechanism to prevent an accidental connection to the wrong server. If the server is configured with a required capability describing it, then only clients with the same configured capability can connect to it. Consequently, if a client is accidentally configured with the wrong port, then it will not send messages to the wrong server.</p>
      <p>Internally Rhapsody uses capabilities on connections for out of process communication points to prevent other systems accidentally connecting to them.</p>
