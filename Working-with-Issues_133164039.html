      <p>Rhapsody 6 has the ability to view a live stream of issues that have been raised by the engine, so you and your team can see what is happening, as it happens. Each issue has a level of severity, so you can see at a glance that everything is running as expected, and know in an instant when something unexpected has happened. With the ability to assign an issue to a user, and an ability to dismiss issues that you have under control, you and your team can be more productive with your time, and focus on the issues that matter. The <strong>Change system notifications</strong> access right is required to perform actions on notifications which do not reference a specific component, for example "Low disk space". Notifications which reference a specific component will require the user to be able to view the component, in other words have the correct <strong>View Locker</strong> access right, in order to perform actions on that notification.</p>
      <h2 id="WorkingwithIssues-IssueSeverityStates">Issue Severity States</h2>
      <p>When an issue is raised in Rhapsody, it will be at either <strong>Warning</strong> or <strong>Alarm</strong> level. A Warning that is triggered by a <em>Numerical Issue</em> can become an Alarm if the circumstances that trigger an Alarm level occur, and an Alarm that remains unresolved for a length of time can become <strong>Escalated</strong>. An issue can also be <strong>Dismissed</strong> through the workflow described on this page, which places it at the lowest level of severity in this model. These levels of severity are indicated throughout the Management Console with the icons displayed in the following table:</p>

      <h2 id="WorkingwithIssues-DismissinganIssue">Dismissing an Issue</h2>
      <p>In the activity stream, the <strong>Dismiss Alert</strong> option is available. This has the effect of visually marking the issue as not as severe, so that you can focus on other issues instead. It is envisioned that you will only do this when you have ascertained the cause or taken remedial actions, for example if you were faced with a large queue issue and you knew of a particular reason that the queue was large, you could increase the queue size threshold so that the queue will no longer be over the threshold.</p>

       <div class="confluence-information-macro-body">
        <p>Dismissing an alert will not mean that the issue will immediately disappear. It will still be active in the system until the system has calculated that it is resolved. The purpose of dismissing is to let you and your team know that the issue is being dealt with.</p>

            <li>The threshold conditions mean that the issue increases in severity. A rise in severity will cancel the dismissed state and resume notifications for the issue. For example, if you dismissed the issue when it was a Warning but now the Alarm threshold has been crossed, the issue will move out of the dismissed state and into the Alarm state. You can then dismiss it again at this new severity level if you believe it should still be dismissed.</li>
            <li>The issue is resolved automatically by the system, as the threshold is no longer met. The issue will move to the <strong>Historical Issues</strong> section.</li>

        <p>We recommend you take advantage of the option to suspend notifications for the issue when performing the <strong>Dismiss Alert</strong> action, as the issue could hover around the threshold for some time before it is finally resolved. In this scenario, the issue could be resolved automatically by the system and then reopened by the system several times before being resolved permanently. The issue will stay in the dismissed state while this is happening, but if you have not suspended notifications, the users who are scheduled to be notified about this issue will be notified each time the issue is reopened.</p>

      <p>Once an issue is Dismissed in the activity stream, there will instead be an option to <strong>Reactivate</strong> the issue. It is envisioned that you will do this when you have decided that whatever reasons you had for Dismissing the issue in the first place are no longer valid. This will have the effect of changing the severity of the issue back to whatever severity it was before it was dismissed.</p>
      <h2 id="WorkingwithIssues-AssigninganIssue">Assigning an Issue</h2>
      <p>When you click <strong>Assign</strong>, you have the option to select a user on your team to assign the issue to. If you assign an issue to someone, they will receive notifications for that issue, even if they do not usually receive notifications for that issue. It will also appear in the <strong>Assigned to Me</strong> section on their <a href="Engine-Monitor_133163816.html">Engine Monitor</a> page.</p>
