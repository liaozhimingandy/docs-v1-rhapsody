      <p>Rhapsody's EDI tools are used to create message and mapping definitions, which can then be associated with a route. There are three types of definitions that can be associated with a route:</p>
      <ul>
       <li>Mapper definition.</li>
       <li>EDI message definition.</li>
       <li><span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">XSD schema</span></span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">.</span></li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="EDITools-WhatisaMessageDefinition?">What is a Message Definition?</h2>
      <p>Message definitions specify the structure of associated messages, such as which segments and fields they contain, or the length and type of information found in them. With this information, Rhapsody is able to selectively route messages depending on their contents or a specific field within the message structure. Mapper definitions describe the mapping of one message format to another.</p>
      <p>Message and Mapper definition files can be created, viewed, and edited using the EDI Tools provided with Rhapsody IDE.</p>
      <p>The three types of message definitions can be used for a variety of functions:</p>
      <ul>
       <li><a href="Creating-a-Mapping-Definition_133163411.html">Mapper definition</a><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">&nbsp;- maps information from a segment in one message format to another. For example, a filter configured with a mapper definition can transform HL7 2.1 to 2.3 without losing any content. Basically, it restructures one message format to another.</span></li>
       <li><a href="Creating-an-EDI-Message-Definition_133163400.html">EDI message definition</a>&nbsp;- defines the structure and separators of the message, when this definition is applied to a route, the route can be configured to analyze only messages that contain a specific structure or have information in a specific location in that message.<span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;"><br></span></li>
       <li><a href="Creating-an-XSD-Schema_133163407.html">XSD schema</a>&nbsp;- knows the structure of an XML file, allows Rhapsody to extract information from incoming messages and insert this information into external databases. There are numerous other tasks that can be performed having the defined structure of a message available to Rhapsody; such as, separating messages according to their content.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="EDITools-WhyUsedefinitionsonaRoute?">Why Use definitions on a Route?</h2>
      <p>Once a message definition has been associated with a route, it becomes possible to selectively route individual messages depending on their structure.</p>
      <p>For example, the <code>ORMO01</code> message definition is part of the HL7 standard and contains fields for new or updated orders. When a physician submits a Lab Order from the source system, the process of formatting an order for transmission to a lab information system begins. After the order has been formatted, it is ready to be processed by a lab. In a hospital environment, the order would go to whatever system is being used to run the lab test. The HL7 Version 2.3.1 message format is used to send the order information. <code>ORM</code> designates an order type messages and <code>O01</code> designates an Order event.</p>
